# Data_wrangling_analysis_Soccer_with_Python

This is a data wrangling projec where the main objective was to parse data from large JSON files in usable format for further analysis. In this poject, several tools were developed and applied on datasets related to the Spanish League for demonstration purpose.

Thesse datasets contain information about events in every soccer match that took place in leagues (2017-18) in England, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, UEFA Champions League, and the 2018 World Cup.  

The original datasets are available in JSON and csv formats in here: https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/Metadata_record_for_A_public_data_set_of_spatio-temporal_match_events_in_soccer_competitions/9711164
